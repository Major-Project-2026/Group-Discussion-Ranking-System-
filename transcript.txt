
SPEAKER 2 0:00:00
As you people are well aware, what is VDS? 
SPEAKER 6 0:00:03
Right? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:03
So today a topic would be given to you. And on that topic, you have to discuss all together as a team. 
SPEAKER 6 0:00:12
Okay? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:13
But each member would consist some points. 
SPEAKER 6 0:00:16
All right? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:17
And we will see comparatively all those three people at one side and rest of the class on the end of the side and accordingly, judgments would be given to you. I hope you are ready? 
SPEAKER 3 0:00:28
Yes. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:29
All right. So let's move ahead. So the topic on which you have to do the discussion is all about AI. As we know, we are living in this 21st century and AI is something which is booming. 
SPEAKER 6 0:00:42
Right? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:43
So I hope you people are ready? 
SPEAKER 3 0:00:45
Yes. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:46
All right. So I request all of you to fall in a circle right there. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:49
So here we go. 
SPEAKER 3 0:00:50
Kena. 
SPEAKER 4 0:00:51
We have seen most of our technical developments in the past few years. And AI is one of them and the biggest of them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:59
AI has given humans a way of living, a way of thinking. 
SPEAKER 4 0:01:03
Because AI has helped develop things that we never imagined. AI has developed things like chat, GPT which helps you write anything you want which helps you get anything you want. It has its own mind of thinking. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:17
As like humans, as like humans, AI can think. 
SPEAKER 4 0:01:21
Artificial intelligence in the name itself suggests that it has got its own intelligence. It has got its own mind. It can think. On the flip side, AI has sold in some jobs. It has snatched some jobs from people who earn living from their jobs. 
SPEAKER 3 0:01:39
And that's it. Anyone else who wants to go to use? 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:46
What I personally believe that if AI is there, then it doesn't impact on the jobs. 
SPEAKER 3 0:01:55
Why? 
SPEAKER 4 0:01:56
Because AI means artificial intelligence. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:59
The person who knows better about the artificial intelligence that person will carry about the jobs. That person will carry forward his job because he knows how to operate AI, how to handle 
SPEAKER 3 0:02:11
AI. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:12
Who can live or who can devote the jobs? The person who don't know. The person who doesn't know about AI. The person who knows better than the company will prefer to pick those people who can 
SPEAKER 4 0:02:31
impact in their company who can be the impactful in their company in terms of AI. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:38
If they know better, how they can operate, how they can manage other things. AI is all about programming. AI is one of the programs that human can have developed. So if they know better, then they don't leave their jobs. They don't know what you're going to leave their jobs. 
SPEAKER 5 0:03:07
I would like to say that whenever there is any change in the technology, especially if we are talking about the AI. So it is an advancement in the technology. It is going to be useful. Let me talk about health. Health has become a very prominent subject in today's life. Everybody is facing health issues. So when we talk about the AI, then we can see that AI has actually reduced the cost. You can actually check out the details, the diseases that you are facing. AI also detect the chronic as well as the acute diseases that you face. Apart from this, the diseases that are faced by the plants or in the agriculture sectors is also detected because AI has got so much technology or we can say it is so advanced that it is capable of detecting the symptoms. 
SPEAKER 4 0:03:58
AI is made up of several things. First the programming language, the person should choose a best programming language. Generally we use two languages either R or Python. But most of the time, like 90% of the person who is an AI or computer science or any other field, they always go with always prefer the Python only. Then later on, you have to learn some libraries which is like NumPy, Pandas, Matrotlip, Seabone and Plotlip. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:31
Then later on, we have to learn machine learning. 
SPEAKER 4 0:04:34
After that, we have to learn deep learning. Deep learning is made up of with the networks. There are three networks over which we have to learn. The first CRNN or ANN. If we learn these and after that, we should have some data. Data said we can take it from Google, we can take it from Microsoft, to Binone and any other companies. And once we will take those data sets from a company. We can run or we can write some programs to work. The machines will make the judgments, will make the decisions by their own. Let's take an example right here. The Tesla. How it works, the self-driving cars, how it works. They have their own data. Once they look at a person or the any car, like in front of them. So they start reducing their speed. They start pushing that break button, like break button or whatever they call it. So it is how it is happening. It is happening because of the data sets that you have trained a machine. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:38
And how machines are doing this? 
SPEAKER 4 0:05:40
The machines are doing this by AI. That they are creating judgment. They are creating decisions by their own. The second thing, the chatGBT. Whatever we write, if we write something, it's called prompt. If we're writing something on chatGT, they create some data or fetch some data or information from the other data sets. And from it goes to a Google Microsoft being in companies data sets. And then it fetch and give to you. And that's all about the AI how it works. And generally, we have to learn that these four to five things which I have told you. 
SPEAKER 3 0:06:19
Let's say. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:22
Recently, there is a proud moment for every Indian and that was none other than Chandrianthri. We can also see that it has impacted us very positive in our nation in other countries too. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:33
And it was all possible because of AI. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:36
You can see and we can all just just this thing that AI has impacted us positive in each and every aspect whether it is about education, health or defense sectors. There are many sectors where AI has impacted us positive. And I would say that in education sector also it has impacted us very positive. For example, if I talk about practical teaching, we can also see that earlier time we used to go with theoretical teachings and all. But now we are all practical thinkers and we are actually going with the practical teaching. And that's how we are actually working upon our mind and students are able to imagine more than their capabilities. And through this only, we are imagining everything and we are making everything possible these days, whether it is about going to the moon, whether it is about impacting giving more chance for the defense sectors. 
SPEAKER 5 0:07:27
That's why I would say AI is helping us in various aspects. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:34
Once speaking of AI, we know very well about the look and edit consequence of AI. But what I personally believe that it is not good for us. It is not good for us. Why because our girl, she was living in the Australia and she was a 25 year soul. A person copied her photo with the constar. So she phased her notes of trouble. It can happen with you too in future. Why it is not good? We know that technology cannot take up place of human beings. Because the white corner jobs, blue corner jobs, people will suffer a lot. Remind me about a one thing about the AI that which is not good at all. The thing is that those who are in those who are doing graphic designing, web design and 
SPEAKER 6 0:08:13
animation. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:15
These people will suffer a lot. Because if AI is doing everything, so why do we need to people? There is no need of people, need to people. So we need, we don't need AI. We need to improve our education system. We have to work upon human beings. So they can work like AI. And he was a person or show a woman was talking about the chat GPT. Yeah, it is good. I'm not saying it is not good. But I don't think so. It is good. 
SPEAKER 6 0:08:40
Chat GPT. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:41
Chat GPT is really not good because a person was doing misicopid the thing and he got failed. In UPSC exam. And we have seen this, the Indian News Channel's too. Chat GPT will not help. Mis the AI will not help in future too. Because we have seen a killer robots. It is also a part of AI. I know AI it is a gendered fifth generation of the computer. But in the future it will not help. It's mean that we are promoting technology. We are not promoting human beings. We should promote human beings. The population of innate almost 140 curodes. The one for take a lot. And you can see that the unemployment rate if AI comes. So how people will suffer? The unemployment rate will also increase. Which will not be a look at it for us. The people will suffer a lot. They will face a lot of circumstances in their life. They will not get a jobs. In the government sector as well as the private sector. If I tell you about the one more thing that in the private sector that people are working in their own, they are almost 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. But if AI comes, they will take place of human beings. So these people will be jobless. They will not get anything. They will suffer. They will not have a money to feed their family. They will not be able to do anything. Whatever they want to do in their life. So we have to do what we want to do. We want to do. We should not be bank on AI.

Kati. 
SPEAKER 3 0:10:13
Tomorrow. Tomorrow. I have a very important job. Hey, brother. You are not going to pay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:24
As we can see the examples of...
