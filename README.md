# Group-Discussion-Ranking-System-
## Overview
The Group Discussion Ranking System is designed to analyze and evaluate participants in a group discussion based on various speech-related metrics. The system processes audio inputs, recognizes speech, and identifies speakers while distinguishing their speech patterns and emotions. The final integration results in a ranking system based on predefined evaluation criteria.

## Project Pipeline 
The system follows a structured pipeline for processing and ranking participants:

### Audio Input Processing
- Captures and preprocesses raw audio from multiple participants.

- Removes background noise and normalizes sound levels.

### Speech Recognition and Processing
- Converts spoken words into machine-readable format.

- Enhances speech clarity and filters out non-verbal sounds.

### Speech-to-Text Conversion
- Transcribe spoken words into text format.

- Ensures accuracy using language models.

### Speaker Diarization
- Identifies and differentiates between multiple speakers.

- Segments the discussion based on who is speaking.

### Speech Distinction
- Analyzes speech patterns, clarity, and engagement level.

- Helps distinguish between active and passive participants.

### Emotion Detection
- Detects emotions from speech using tone, pitch, and modulation.

- Evaluates participantsâ€™ confidence, enthusiasm, and assertiveness.

### Integration & Ranking
- Combines all extracted data for participant evaluation.

- Generates rankings based on predefined scoring metrics.
